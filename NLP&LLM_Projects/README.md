## [Project 1: LangChain Data Science Assistant]()
### Context
The project aims to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) within the LangChain framework to build a Data Science Assistant and make Data Analysis and Science more accessible to a broader audience. This assistant will automate tasks such as Data Analysis, Data Science & Machine Learning Modeling, Relational Database Querying, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Contextual Answers. 

## [Project 2: Support Ticket Categorization](https://github.com/wissaljawad/Projects/blob/main/NLP%26LLM_Projects/Ticketing_%20Automation.ipynb)
### Context
This project focuses on automated Support Ticket Categorization, leveraging Large Language Models and Generative AI. The objective is to develop an application that predicts ticket categories, assigns priority, suggests resolution times, performs sentiment analysis, and stores results in a structured DataFrame.

## [Project 3: Text Preprocessing](https://github.com/wissaljawad/Projects/blob/main/NLP%26LLM_Projects/TextPreprocessing.ipynb)
### Context
This Jupyter notebook addresses text preprocessing using *NLTK and spaCy*. Key steps include stopword removal, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, collocation identification, and named entity recognition.

## [Project 4: Large Language Model Demonstration](https://github.com/wissaljawad/Projects/blob/main/NLP%26LLM_Projects/LLM_Demo.ipynb)
### Context
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Large Language Models, specifically Transformer-based structures, in addressing important Natural Language Processing (NLP) difficulties. Hugging Face is the fundamental tool used in this exercise for *Text Completion, Text Classification, Question-Answering, Text Summarization, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Language Translation, and Text Generation.**

## [Project 5: Machine Translation with LSTM](https://github.com/wissaljawad/Projects/blob/main/NLP%26LLM_Projects/Language_Translation_LSTM.ipynb)
### Context
Machine translation (MT) involves translating text between languages using computational and linguistic knowledge. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a modern approach using deep neural networks, with encoder and decoder networks typically built using recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), or other alternatives. *This case study employs a simple RNN model with LSTM nodes for translation tasks.*

## [Project 6: Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews](https://github.com/wissaljawad/Projects/blob/main/NLP%26LLM_Projects/Movie_Reviews_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)
### Context
Sentiment analysis, a Natural Language Processing technique, automates determining the positivity or negativity of reviews. This project aims to analyze 10,000 IMDB movie reviews using supervised and unsupervised learning methods, *comparing techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, TextBlob, and VADER Sentiment.*

## [Project 7: Pinecone Q&A](https://github.com/wissaljawad/Projects/blob/main/NLP&LLM_Projects/PineconeQ&A.ipynb)
### Context
This notebook demonstrates how Pinecone helps build an abstractive question-answering system. Abstractive question-answering focuses on the generation of multi-sentence answers to open-ended questions. It usually works by searching massive document stores for relevant information and then using this information to synthetically generate answers.
