## Project 1: Machine Translation with LSTM
### Context
Machine translation (MT) involves translating text between languages using computational and linguistic knowledge. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a modern approach using deep neural networks, with encoder and decoder networks typically built using recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), or other alternatives. This case study employs a simple RNN model with LSTM nodes for translation tasks.

## Project 2: Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews
### Context
Movie reviews influence decisions on whether to watch a film. Sentiment analysis, a Natural Language Processing technique, automates determining the positivity or negativity of reviews. This project aims to analyze 10,000 IMDB movie reviews using supervised and unsupervised learning methods, comparing techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, TextBlob, and VADER Sentiment.

## Project 3: StoicBot - Navigating Life's Philosophical Seas
### Context
StoicBot, a chatbot inspired by Stoic philosophy, is built on the BERT model, fine-tuned using the SQuAD2.0 dataset. Trained on a set of 35 questions and answers, it operates in a closed-domain, generating responses based on compiled content. Utilizing the Hugging Face Transformers library, the chatbot prompts users to ask life-related questions, providing answers from the QA_input list.

## Project 4: Text Preprocessing
### Context
Text data poses challenges with special characters and word inflections. This Jupyter notebook addresses text preprocessing using NLTK and spaCy. Key steps include stopword removal, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, collocation identification, and named entity recognition.

## Project 5: NLP Mid-term Project - Support Ticket Categorization
### Context
In the business landscape, customer feedback is crucial. This project focuses on automated Support Ticket Categorization, leveraging Large Language Models and Generative AI. The objective is to develop an application that predicts ticket categories, assigns priority, suggests resolution times, performs sentiment analysis, and stores results in a structured DataFrame.
